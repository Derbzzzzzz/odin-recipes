        Let's get cooking!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mayo or salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
        <li>1 of pinch salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat.
        </li>
        <li> Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. 
             Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.
